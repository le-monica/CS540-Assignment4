# Python Page Replacement Algorithms
This Python program simulates different page replacement algorithms: LRU (Least Recently Used), Optimal, and FIFO (First In First Out). 
It takes a page reference string and the specified number of frames as input to simulate page replacement and calculates the number of page faults for each implemented algorithm.

## Instructions for Execution
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system or a compiler that can execute Python or use an Online-IDE that can compile Python.

2. Download the 'cs540assignment4.py' file to your device.

3. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is saved and excute by using 'python cs540assignment3.py'

4. Or on your own compiler/online compiler, open the file and execute.
